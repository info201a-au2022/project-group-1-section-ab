## Abstract
Our main question is to investigate the pattern of child malnutrition over geography and time. As a minority group, children have been majorly excluded from the information system. Therefore, it is significantly important for us to pay more attention to them. In helping to address this problem, especially for children in marginal regions, we will present a comprehensive analysis of the data on this topic with the aim of driving more attention to them.

## Keywords
Health, Malnutrition, Stunting, Children

## Introduction
Concerned with child health issues, this project aims to analyze and visualize child malnutrition on the global scale in recent years. As UNICEF pointed out, “undernutrition puts children at greater risk of dying from common infections, increases the frequency and severity of such infections, and delays recovery” (Malnutrition in Children, 2022), good nutritional conditions are the foundation for children to thrive. However, the health status of children from minoritized groups is often out of the view of dominant groups. Therefore, revealing the changing process of child malnutrition around the world can arouse people’s awareness of this problem. In this project, we would use the survey estimates about child malnutrition provided by UNICEF to present the distributions of stunting, wasting, and overweight children under the age of five in different regions from 2000 to 2020. Through this data analysis and visualization, we hope to improve public understanding of child malnutrition and thus contribute to actions to address this problem.

## Problem Domain
Health issues, especially children's health, have always been a social issue that deserves to be discussed and focused on. For infants and young children, and for children under the age of three, malnutrition can be deadly. By 2020, nearly half of all under-five deaths could be attributed to malnutrition (Malnutrition in Children, 2022). Malnutrition will increase the risk of children dying from other common infections (Children: Improving survival and well-being, 2020). Fortunately, as civilization and the economy progressed, attention toward these issues were slowly and steadily raised. Unfortunately, compared to the total population, only a small percentage of people are concerned, and even fewer are taking action to improve. Although the prevalence of stunting has been declining since 2000, more than one in five children under the age of five were stunted in 2020, and 45.4 million of the 149.2 million children under the age of five are still suffering from wasting(Malnutrition in Children, 2022). The analysis we have done shows how malnutrition in children is, and we also hope that more people will pay attention to it and end this tragedy.  
For our analysis, people who have been concerned about children and children's health, Child Welfare Organizations and policymakers will be the direct stakeholders of this webpage. They will actively search and browse such websites and statistical analysis to more accurately help children in distress. Those indirect stakeholders such as producers and manufactures of child food will most likely be affected if our analysis is seen by a large enough number of people. Companies and factories will rigorously ration and maximize the nutrition that children can get from food. Coupled with improved policies and special attention to certain families, marginalized and malnourished children will also be cared for and treated.  
At the same time, our analysis will achieve the human values of safety and system reliability, which are mutually reinforcing in the case of child malnutrition and child health. When child malnutrition is given more attention and improved, the health and safety of children will be ensured. When parents see business, organizations and government’s efforts to focus on children's health, their system reliability for society will rise. Likewise, when citizens see that marginalization is being addressed, they will have more hope for their lives.  
The concern for children's health is a natural benefit of our analysis. This also answers the question “How might the system influence how people make and sustain friendships and family relationships?” in Time domain (Sustained friendships - envisioning cards, 2011). This website could strengthen family relationships by improving a child’s safety and health. But at the same time, this analysis has the potential to push mothers and even women into invective. As we all know, the majority of those responsible for caring for infants and children are still mothers or women. When the issue of child malnutrition is put under the public spotlight, those who are responsible for caring for children, mothers and women, are likely to be accused of being irresponsible.

## Research Questions
1. What is the current prevalence of children suffering from malnutrition?
The preliminary work is to learn the number of undernourished children with each symptom in the current world. Based on this factual data, we would develop a basic understanding of child malnutrition. More importantly, those who are concerned about this issue could obtain quantitative evidence for their work.

2. How much progress has been made in resolving child malnutrition in recent years?
Next, we want to see how the number and proportion of child malnutrition have changed over the past two decades. The trend of the improvement in children’s nutritional levels could motivate people to reflect on the systemic reliability of relevant fields, such as the food supply market.

3. How the extent of child malnutrition varies by country and by region?
Furthermore, we intend to examine whether child malnutrition is disproportionately distributed worldwide. In particular, the relationship between the nutritional status of children in different regions and the local economic strength is worth exploring. Based on these results, policymakers in each country can formulate solutions.

## The Dataset
* Description of dataset  
* Stunting - Prevalence   
Stunting refers to children who are too short for his or her height. In this dataset, the percentage of children aged 0-59 months whose height-for-age was below minus two standard deviations from WHO child growth standards was recorded for 87 different countries and territories from 2000 to 2020.
* Overweight - Prevalence  
Overweight refers to children who are too heavy for his or her height. In this dataset, the percentage of children aged 0-59 months whose weight-for-height was higher than minus two standard deviations from WHO child growth standards was recorded for 87 different countries and territories from 2000 to 2020.
* Wasting - Prevalence & Numbers  
Wasting refers to children who are too thin for his or her height. In this dataset, the percentage of children aged 0-59 months whose weight-for-height was above minus three standard deviations from WHO child growth standards in 2020 was recorded for 87 different countries and territories.
* Overall  
These three aspects together make up the data on child malnutrition, and they all contain data over time and by country and region, allowing us to reach our research objective, which is to investigate the pattern of child malnutrition over geography and time. By comparing the data across different years, we can analyze our research question.
