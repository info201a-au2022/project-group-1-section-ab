## Abstract
Our main question is to investigate the pattern of child malnutrition over geography and time. As a minority group, children have been majorly excluded from the information system. Therefore, it is significantly important for us to pay more attention to them. In helping to address this problem, especially for children in marginal regions, we will present a comprehensive analysis of the data on this topic with the aim of driving more attention to them.

## Keywords
Health, Malnutrition, Stunting, Children

## Introduction
Concerned with child health issues, this project aims to analyze and visualize child malnutrition on the global scale in recent years. As UNICEF pointed out, “undernutrition puts children at greater risk of dying from common infections, increases the frequency and severity of such infections, and delays recovery” (Malnutrition in Children, 2022), good nutritional conditions are the foundation for children to thrive. However, the health status of children from minoritized groups is often out of the view of dominant groups. Therefore, revealing the changing process of child malnutrition around the world can arouse people’s awareness of this problem. In this project, we would use the survey estimates about child malnutrition provided by UNICEF to present the distributions of stunting, wasting, and overweight children under the age of five in different regions from 2000 to 2020. Through this data analysis and visualization, we hope to improve public understanding of child malnutrition and thus contribute to actions to address this problem.
