# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[aggregate_table.R](./aggregate_table.R) | The R code for combining data and calculating the aggregate table. 
|[app.R](./app.R) | The R code for shiny app. 
|[app_server.R](./app_server.R) | The R code for shiny app server. 
|[app_ui.R](./app_ui.R) | The R code for shiny app UI. 




# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them in the table above
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore,
